{- 
The value at the key might not exist so you canâ€™t write a v -> v function. 
You need to handle the case where the value is and is not there. 
So, add a student and sort the list if the value is there.
Make a new list with the student if nothing was at that key.
The maybe value return type gives you the ability to delete the value if you return Nothing.
